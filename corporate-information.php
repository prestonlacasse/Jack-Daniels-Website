                  <p style="width: 50%;">Brown-Forman’s culture is a direct reflection of our deeply held core values of integrity, respect, trust, teamwork, and excellence. Our values permeate everything we do and guide our actions with employees, shareholders, customers, and communities.</p>
                  <p style="width: 50%;">We believe that the collective wisdom of all employees is far superior to the individual intellect of any one person. The result is a collegial company where employees are recognized for their unique skills and talents while leaning on diverse teams and perspective to achieve success.</p>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 800;">Professional Development</h4>
                  <p style="width: 50%;">At Brown-Forman, we are committed to developing the people who build our brands. We begin by recruiting and hiring people of the highest quality and character and then giving them the on-the-job experiences, personal connections and formal training necessary to grow, learn, and realize their full potential.</p>
                  <p style="width: 50%;">Recognizing that leaders set the tone for the organization, we are firmly committed to leader development. Our award-winning global leadership development programs build leader capabilities, create experiences to learn and grow, and foster connections across the organization. The programs enable leaders to thrive at every stage of their leadership journey...and help build a culture where every employee can be their best self.</p>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 800;">Diversity and Inclusion</h4>
                  <p style="width: 50%;">We believe having a diverse workforce honors the wealth of unique experiences that each of us brings to work and respects our differences as people. Inclusion unleashes the power of diversity by creating a culture that empowers all employees to fully express themselves and feel comfortable being who they are while contributing their talents to the business.</p>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left; font-weight: 800;">Community Relations</h4>
